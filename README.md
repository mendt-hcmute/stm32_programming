(Due to my limited experience in recording videos, my voice is too low and there is a lot of background noise. Not recommended for viewing at this time.)

The project focuses on MiROS (Minimal Real-Time Operating System) for the STM32F103C8, featuring three blinky tasks on pins PB9, PB8, and PB7, which can be found in Lesson 11. This implementation uses a normal delay (not OS_delay) and employs a non-blocking Round-Robin scheduling method.

Updates on blocking and priority handling in MiROS will be provided soon.
